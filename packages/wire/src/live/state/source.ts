 * session/resource.
 *
 * Invariant: `current` is only ever *replaced* by a new reference (via
 * `produce()` and `reseed()`), never mutated in place. `snapshot()` clones on
 * the way out so the public API never leaks a live internal reference.
 *
 * Keep the state T as plain JSON (no Date/Map/Set/class instances). Patches
 * travel as opaque unknown across the wire; non-JSON values in the patched
 * result cause validation failures and resync loops on the client.
